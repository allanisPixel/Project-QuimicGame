# Project-QuimicGame
The project is a game designed for high school students to learn chemistry concepts in a less boring way, preferably without realizing they are studying.
The project is my course completion work (TCC), at the Instituto Federal Rio Grande do Norte (IFRN)

- The focus of the project will be Brazilian high school students;
- The game will be a turn-based tactical style where the terrain and locations on the board are of great importance.
  - concepts of chemical reactions will be used in combat (such as throwing a base substance to neutralize an area that is stained with acid, creating salts and water)
  - The story of chemical discoveries will be the background of the adventure and the scientists will be characters.
  - the story will be set in a fictional parallel reality (it's actually inside a chemistry school book)
